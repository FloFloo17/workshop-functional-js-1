## Exercises

Please verify that after all exercises the linter should not return errors.

### Exercise 1

Implement the function +zip(input)+ in file **_src/exercise1.js_** where the input is an array of grouped elements, the first of which contains the first elements of the given arrays, the second of which contains the second elements of the given arrays, and so on.

You don't understand what you need to do ?

Don't stress tests are written in file **_test/exercise1.test.js_** to explain the behaviour of the function.

All tests should pass with success.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

	git add .

	git commit -m "Exercise 1"

### Exercise 2

The function +reverseYolo(input)+ in file **_src/exercise2.js_** has been implemented by an another developper and the test is present in **_test/exercise2.js_**, but he forgot to commit the input to pass the test ...

Could you guess the input "whereIsMyMind" please ? Becareful only this input should change.

The test should pass with success.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

	git add .

	git commit -m "Exercise 2"

### Exercise 3

Implement the function +reverseString(input)+ in file **_src/exercise3.js_** where the input is a string, the output the same string but in a reverse order.

It's an easy task with old known functions, BUT the real challenge is to do this in a recursive way.

You don't understand what you need to do ?

All tests are written in file **_test/exercise3.test.js_** and they should pass with success.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

	git add .

	git commit -m "Exercise 3"

### Exercise 4

Implement the function +asyncYolo()+ in file **_src/exercise4.js_**, the output is always the same.

The difficulty is to use the 2 promises defined before to return the result.

There is another problem, the test written in file **_test/exercise4.test.js_** is good but only in a synchronous way, you should update it to become asynchronous friendly.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

	git commit -m "Exercise 4"
